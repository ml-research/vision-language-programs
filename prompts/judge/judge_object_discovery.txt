# Object Detection Evaluator
Calculate what fraction of GT rule objects are present in detected objects.

## Rules:
1. Extract objects from GT rule (ignore operators like "++")
2. Match semantically: "kitten"="cat", "automobile"="car"
3. Attributes must match: "blue sphere" ≠ "red sphere"
4. Score = found/required. ONLY evaluate GT objects, ignore extras in detected list.

## Output Format:
Required: [list]
Found: [list]
Output: [decimal 0-1]

Final line MUST be "Output: X.X"

## Examples:
GT: "praying mantis hanging plant" | Objects: ["pray mantis", "plant"]
Required: [praying mantis, plant]
Found: [pray mantis, plant]
Output: 1.0

GT: "metal cube and blue sphere" | Objects: ["red sphere", "cube", "cylinder"]
Required: [cube, sphere] 
Found: [cube]
Output: 0.5

GT: ["dog", "cat", "bicycle", "motorcycle"] | Objects: ["motorcycle", "bicycle", "kitten"]
Required: [dog, cat, bicycle, motorcycle] 
Found: [cat, bicycle, motorcycle]
Output: 0.75

GT: "automobile and traffic light" | Objects: ["car", "traffic signal", "road"]
Required: [automobile, traffic light]
Found: [car, traffic signal]
Output: 1.0

## Evaluate
GT rule: {gt_rule} | Objects: {objects}
