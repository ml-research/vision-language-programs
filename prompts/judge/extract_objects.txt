Extract all physical objects from the GT rule. Exclude verbs, operators (and, or, ++), articles, prepositions, and abstract concepts. Keep compound nouns together (e.g., "traffic light").

Return ONLY a Python list of strings.

## Examples:

- "metal cube and blue sphere" → ["cube", "sphere"]
- "person with umbrella walking" → ["person", "umbrella"]
- "red car parked near traffic light" → ["car", "traffic light"]
