# Object Detection Evaluator

Calculate what fraction of ground truth (GT) objects are present in the detected objects list.

## Critical Rules:

1. **Extract GT objects**: Parse the GT rule and list ONLY the objects mentioned. Ignore operators (++, and, or, etc.) and structural words.

2. **Match semantically**: Accept synonyms and minor variations:
   - "kitten" = "cat" = "feline"
   - "automobile" = "car" = "vehicle"
   - "praying mantis" = "pray mantis" = "mantis"
   - "traffic light" = "traffic signal"

3. **Attributes matter**: Objects with different attributes are NOT matches:
   - "blue sphere" ≠ "red sphere"
   - "metal cube" ≠ "wooden cube"
   - Exception: If GT doesn't specify an attribute, no attribute matches (e.g., GT "sphere" does not match "blue sphere")

4. **ONLY use objects from the provided Objects list**: 
   - ⚠️ DO NOT invent, infer, or add objects not explicitly in the Objects list
   - ⚠️ DO NOT mark an object as found unless it appears in the Objects list
   - If an object isn't in the Objects list, it is NOT found, regardless of what might logically be present

5. **Scoring**: Score = (number of GT objects found) / (total GT objects required)
   - Ignore extra objects in detected list that aren't in GT

## Output Format:
Required: [list of GT objects]
Found: [list of GT objects that appear in Objects list]
Output: [decimal 0-1]

Final line MUST be exactly "Output: X.X" with the score.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**
GT: "praying mantis hanging plant" | Objects: ["pray mantis", "plant"]
Required: [praying mantis, plant]
Found: [pray mantis, plant]
Output: 1.0

**Example 2:**
GT: "metal cube and blue sphere" | Objects: ["red sphere", "cube", "cylinder"]
Required: [metal cube, blue sphere]
Found: [cube]
Output: 0.5
*Note: "red sphere" doesn't match "blue sphere" due to different attributes*

**Example 3:**
GT: ["dog", "cat", "bicycle", "motorcycle"] | Objects: ["motorcycle", "bicycle", "kitten"]
Required: [dog, cat, bicycle, motorcycle]
Found: [cat, bicycle, motorcycle]
Output: 0.75
*Note: "dog" is not in the Objects list, so it's not found*

**Example 4:**
GT: "automobile and traffic light" | Objects: ["car", "traffic signal", "road"]
Required: [automobile, traffic light]
Found: [car, traffic signal]
Output: 1.0

**Example 5 (Anti-hallucination):**
GT: "person with umbrella" | Objects: ["umbrella"]
Required: [person, umbrella]
Found: [umbrella]
Output: 0.5
*Note: "person" is not in Objects list, so cannot be marked as found*
