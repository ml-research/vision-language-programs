# Extract Actions from GT Rule

Extract all actions from the GT rule. Exclude nouns (objects), adjectives (properties), operators (and, or, ++), articles, and prepositions. Focus on verbs, gerunds, and action-describing words that indicate what objects are doing.

Return ONLY a Python list of strings.

## Examples:
- "person running in the park and a kid jumping" → ["running", "jumping"]
- "dog jumping over fence" → ["jumping"]
- "bird flying above tree" → ["flying"]
- "car accelerating on highway" → ["accelerating"]

## Extract:
