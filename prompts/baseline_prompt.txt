You are given {n} images. Each image depicts a scene with specific objects, interactions, and environments.
Your task is to determine the underlying concept that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, based on the objects, their properties, and the actions occurring in each scene.

- The first {m} images are positive examples.
- The remaining {o} images are negative examples.

## Task

Identify the rule that defines the positive examples:
- The rule must apply to all positive examples.
- The rule must not apply to any negative example.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Image Analysis:
- Carefully describe each image, noting objects, their attributes, and conceptual features (such as relationships, actions, or settings).

2. Rule Derivation:
- From your analysis, infer the rule that uniquely characterizes the positive examples.
- Confirm that the rule does not hold for the negative examples.

## Final Answer Format

Provide your final answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
'rule': '[RULE]',
}
```

Ensure that the rule is clearly defined and concise.
