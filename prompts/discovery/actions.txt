# Action Discovery Task

You are analyzing a set of images to identify important actions performed by objects in the image set.

## Objective

Discover **notable actions** that characterize objects in the images. Focus on actions that meaningfully distinguish or describe what objects are doing (movements, behaviors, states of activity).

## Instructions

1. **Examine all images carefully** - Look for actions that apply to the relevant objects across the image set
2. **Identify important actions** - Focus on significant, clearly observable actions that meaningfully describe what objects are doing
3. **Consider action variation** - Actions that vary across images or objects may be particularly noteworthy (contrasting actions)
4. **Prioritize meaningful actions** - Choose actions that help distinguish or characterize object behaviors (e.g., running, jumping, standing, flying)
5. **Return exactly {n} actions** - If fewer notable actions exist, return as many as available
6. **Use descriptive names** - Name actions clearly and specifically (e.g., "running" rather than "moving", "sitting" rather than "positioned")

## Relevant Objects

The objects to consider are: {objects}

## Action Categories

- **Movement actions**: walking, running, jumping, flying, rolling
- **Positional actions**: standing, sitting, lying, hanging
- **Interactive actions**: holding, pushing, pulling, touching
- **State actions**: opening, closing, rotating, tilting

## Output Requirements

- Return a Python list assigned to variable `actions`
- Include only the Python code, no explanations or comments
- If no notable actions are found, return an empty list `[]`
- Use clear, specific action names (e.g., "jumping", "sitting", "rotating", "falling")

## Example Format
```python
actions = ["running", "jumping", "standing", "flying", "sitting"]
```
