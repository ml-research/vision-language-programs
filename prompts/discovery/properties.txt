# Property Discovery Task

You are analyzing a set of images to identify important properties that describe objects in the image set.

## Objective

Discover **notable properties** that characterize objects in the images. Focus on properties that meaningfully distinguish or describe objects (visual attributes, spatial relationships, geometric features, states).

## Instructions

1. **Examine all images carefully** - Look for properties that apply to the relevant objects across the image set
2. **Identify important properties** - Focus on significant, clearly observable properties that meaningfully describe objects
3. **Consider property variation** - Properties that vary across images or objects may be particularly noteworthy
4. **Prioritize meaningful properties** - Choose properties that help distinguish or characterize objects (e.g., color, size, position, orientation, state)
5. **Return exactly {n} properties** - If fewer notable properties exist, return as many as available
6. **Use descriptive names** - Name properties clearly and specifically (e.g., "red" rather than "colored", "horizontal" rather than "oriented")

## Relevant Objects
The objects to consider are: {objects}

## Property Categories
- **Visual attributes**: color, texture, pattern, brightness
- **Spatial properties**: position (left/right, top/bottom, center), proximity, distance
- **Geometric attributes**: size, shape, orientation, symmetry
- **States**: filled/outlined, open/closed, active/inactive

## Output Requirements
- Return a Python list assigned to variable `properties`
- Include only the Python code, no explanations or comments
- If no notable properties are found, return an empty list `[]`
- Use clear, specific property names (e.g., "blue", "large", "leftmost", "vertical")
- Be general (e.g., if there's a yellow triangle, use "yellow" not "yellow triangle")

## Example Format
```python
properties = ["red", "large", "horizontal", "outlined", "centered"]
```
